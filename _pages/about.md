I am a tenure-track assistant professor of the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University working with Professor [Shan Lin](https://www.ece.sunysb.edu/~slin/) in 2022. I got my bachelor's degree of Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2015 with a major in Computer Science.

My research interests are broadly in the areas of Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Control, and Data Science.
